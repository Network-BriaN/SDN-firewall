Implementation of Firewall and  Controller redundancy in Software Defined Networks

In recent years, software-defined networking (SDN) has evolved to replace the traditional design of the current network. SDN is the emerging network architecture which splits the functions of networking devices into two groups, namely the control plane and the data plane and is controlled by the centralized controller using the OpenFlow Protocol. Even though the new network architecture has simplified the control of networks, one of the fundamental issues exposed due to the new architecture of SDN is the security risks. Network Firewalls are one of the most important components used in networks. It helps in securing traffic and enforces  security policies. The speed of the firewall is a hindrance, often firewallâ€™s link speeds are slower than the supported network interface and can cause the traffic burst from the host to be buffered until packets are processed. To overcome these issues, the aim of this project is to implement some firewall functionalities on SDN to create duplicate instances of the firewall with the help of Ryu Controller.
